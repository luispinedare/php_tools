# 👨‍💻 Luis Pineda — PHP Tools for Secure and Dynamic Data Management

Welcome!  
This repository is part of my open portfolio as a **Junior Cybersecurity Specialist** (CompTIA Security+ Certified), demonstrating my skills in **secure coding**, **data handling**, and **dynamic content generation** using PHP and MySQL.

Here you will find lightweight, modular, and security-focused PHP scripts ready for real-world applications and continuous development.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Concepts Applied

- **PHP**: Procedural Programming, secure HTML generation.
- **MySQL**: Querying, grouping, filtering data.
- **JSON**: Dynamic structure generation for API-ready outputs.
- **Security Practices**:
  - Input sanitization and validation.
  - Prevention of SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
  - Separation of sensitive configurations (`config.php`).
- **Good Coding Standards**: Clean code, modular design, separation of concerns.

## 🔒 Security Highlights

- All user inputs are sanitized and validated before processing.
- Sensitive credentials (`config.php`) are excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.
- Dynamic content and HTML attributes are securely escaped to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- Clean error handling prevents exposing technical details to users.
